Snowballs filled with dreams, flurry of life<br>
Falling on my head, I'm gazing in wild.<br>
I try to capture as much as I can,<br>
Still, there is always something more to find.

I see those lights on the farthest of mountains,<br>
Wondering what could be there, to feel I strive.<br>
Sometimes chaos takes over, brains collapse,<br>
We wake up stronger, coming back to life.

I have been collecting colors in shattered jars of glass,<br>
See if my rainbow lacks some shades of your eyes.<br>
We will search them together, in wan moonlights,<br>
And we will make the most colorful skies.
